Between NiceGUI and Streamlit, I have opted for Streamlit as it looks nicer out
of the box and is less verbose, plus I am not concerned about web performance 
of web components right now.

Building a UI with either of these means that I do not need to worry about 
'proper' web development. These UI can be built right on top of python logic.

The next step up would be to use Flask with Bulma CSS and Vanilla JS.

The next step would be to use FastAPI with 'real' CSS and JS frameworks.

I want to build a system that lets user input their own API keys for access.

Then it should generate learning content that can be rated / saved by users.

This data should be collected regarding preferred notes, questions, etc. 

This data can be used to fine-tune a learning assistant.

Since this is going to be built with gemini, it'll be a litte hard to swap out
the models if the need ever arises. I should aim for a loosely coupled
architecture.

I've updated the method of parsing the toc from a pdf. There's a new structure 
in which the toc and pdf doc are stored. I need to update the methods that 
use the toc data to be compatible with the new format.

It was a fun problem to solve but if development speed was the aim, then I 
could have opted for a less elegant approach, not worried as much about clarity,
or relied more heavily on AI.

Created llm_utils containing all needed methods for interacting with the llm.

Next step is build the frontend using streamlit. I've been through some of 
their guides and docuemntation and am currently going through the uber_pickups
tutorial. I should finish off learning streamlit next time and then build my 
own frontend.

Finished Uber tutorial.
Next is multipage tutorial and how to deploy to streamlit community cloud.

[30/06/25]=====================================================================

Need to work on getting the toc.json into a format compatible with st-ant-tree

Also need to look into making this a multipage setup:
